Simple crawler for the Swedish discussion forum 'familjeliv'. As it crawls, it
automatically backups the sites it has visited and will visit each 10 pages it
goes through.

If you want to use it, then run:
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    python3 crawler.py [URL_TO_SUBFORUM]

Where [URL_TO_SUBFORUM] could be for example https://www.familjeliv.se/forum/26

There is an additional script `get_tsv.py` which takes a folder of json files
like `crawler.py` outputs and converts it into a tsv file which can easily be
read by Pandas.
