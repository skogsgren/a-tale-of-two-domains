# A Tale of Two Domains: Automatic Hate Speech Detection in Cross-Domain Scenarios

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skogsgren/a-tale-of-two-domains/main/angry_bert.jpg" width=33% height=33%>

This repo contains the code for my bachelor's thesis, title above, which
concerns itself with --- as the title suggests --- automatic hate speech
detection in cross-domain scenarios, specifically by using automatically
derived training data in comparison to two other baselines (annotated data from
another domain, as well as ChatGPT).

### Data Availability

Because of privacy concerns none of the data can be shared here; however, for
the discussion forum 'Familjeliv' I have provided the code for the crawler,
which should be easy to set up and get the data used for this thesis.
